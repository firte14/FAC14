Hot Beans want their website to attract skilled prospective web developers who have finished their training courses and qualifications that are now looking for jobs as web developers, to recruit them. The main goal is to create a compelling careers section that will inform the prospective candidates about the company in general, showcase the available job opportunities and an online application form that is simple to complete. The key requirements and how they will be addressed include:
1. Promotion of the company to prospective web developers: To address this the creation of a well-structured "About Hot Beans" web section that will highlight the mission statement of the company as well as its values, work culture and all-round reputation in the industry. This section will build the company's credibility and excitement for potential candidates.
2. Details on the available Job Roles and requirements: There will be a dedicated "Job Openings" section with the clear job roles needed, descriptions, responsibilities, required qualifications and the benefits. Each job posting will include an easy-to-access "Apply Now" button to encourage applications.
3. An easy-to-use Application Form: Creation of a streamlined online application form that is mobile-friendly and intuitive. It will include different fields for personal details, resume uploads, cover letter, etc. The automated validation will ensure a smooth user experience
4. Profiles showcasing existing trainee web developers: A web section for "Meet Our Team" will be implemented, the section will feature profiles of current web developers who are currently in training at Hot Beans Web. This will provide social proof and motivate potential applicants by showing the real career growth that is possible within the company
5. Links to web development courses: A "Web Development Resources"section that will list links to high-quality online learning platforms like FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, etc. The resources will help aspiring developers continue learning and enhance their qualifications.

## 3. Testing Documentation
### 3.1 Test Plans
The test plan will include the strategy that'll be used for testing the Hot Beans careers website to ensure that it meets the functional, performance and usability requirements. The website is built with the use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the styling and structure with JavaScript. Various testing methods will be implemented to thoroughly test the website, these will include User Acceptance Testing(UAT), Manual testing and Automated testing procedures.

The Testing Approach
The testing will be conducted in different stages
Unit Testing: This will involve testing the individual components (e.g. navigation, buttons, forms)
separately
Integration Testing: This will be implemented to validate the interaction between components
Functional Testing: To ensure all functionalities work as expected(e.g, Job search, Job submission)
UI/UX Testing: Checking the Bootstrap-based design for its responsiveness and consistency to actions 
Performance Testing: Evaluating the effectiveness of the website's load times and responsiveness
User Acceptance Testing: Allowing end-users or customers to test the website to make sure it meets their requirements, verifying its usability
